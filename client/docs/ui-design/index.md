## Stories

### Story 1
    Bob, an Amherst local wakes up one morning ready to make cereal only to find that he is out of milk. Fortunately, he heard of a new website, Farmstand that could save his breakfast. Upon loading into the website, he is faced with the Farmstand homepage, that contains information about the website, a farm and food search page, and a famer stand login page. Motivated by an empty stomach, Bob decided that the food search page was his best bet. A smile crept across Bobs face upon loading into the Farmstand list page as various ingredients from local farms were displayed across the page. Overjoyed, Bob typed the word "milk" into the search bar at the top of the page and watched eagerly as Farmstand brought up a list of farms ordered by proximity to Bob, each with the ingredient that he desired most. However, Bob has been short on change recently, so instead decides to sort the list of farms by price instead, and as he expected, the Farmstead website rose to the challenge, displaying farms with the cheapest milk first.

Section 2: Innovative Idea

There is an increasing demand for locally-sourced foods. Consumers want food that is good for their body while supporting local farmers and businesses. This app serves as an alternative to third party supermarkets, by connecting consumers directly to producers. Farmers will be able to list their self-sourced food products for local customers to see and purchase. They will essentially host a virtual farmstand. 

Section 3: Data

The four types of data this application will support are: Farm type, Food type, Shopping list, and a Recipe data type. The food type will be used to display essential information related to each product. The Farm type will be used to keep track of and display the farm's current inventory and location. The shopping list will be used to keep track of items that are saved by the user. Lastly, the Recipe data type will be used to list the types and quantities of ingredients required for a given recipe.


Section 4: Functionality

Our four functionalities are finding foods, browsing stands, searching the map, and browsing recipes. Users can find local foods in the area with a food search. For example, a user could find all the local sources of eggs. Users can also browse specific farm stands. For example, one farm stand might specialize in organic produce, so a user could look at all the items that stand offers. Users can also look on the map at all of the stands and foods in the area, so they could see the location and proximity easily. Finally, users could browse the recipes to find recipes they could make with local ingredients. Stands could also post recipes using their own items.
